Images and any assets that are ready to go to be put on the website and which you already have chosen a specific use for.. Please name them accordingly (e.g. homepage-background.png, icon.png, menu-box.png... etc..).  Use a name that tells me what it's going to be for and put them in this folder. 

If they are just random photos, or up to me to chose what to use it for, or requires some editing or whatever.. that is not an asset, that would be a resource.

Assets = Ready to be used items which will show up on the page in a specific place.
Resources = Collection of individual things (transparencies, vector graphics, logos, etc..) which can be used as they are or modified or combined to create an asset.
Photos = Raw photographs for a gallery or slideshow or whatever.. no specific purpose.  Would probably have to be used as is, not really modifiable like a resource.
